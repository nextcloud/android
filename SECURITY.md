# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version is supported. We release every second month a feature release (currently 3.x) and inbetween a bug fix release (3.x.y).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to us. If you have discovered a security issue with Nextcloud,
please read our responsible disclosure guidelines and contact us at [hackerone.com/nextcloud](https://hackerone.com/nextcloud).
Your report should include:

- Product version
- A vulnerability description
- Reproduction steps

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix.
The fix will be applied to the master branch, tested, and packaged in the next bug fix release.
The vulnerability will be publicly announced after the release. Finally, your name will be added
to the [hall of fame](https://hackerone.com/nextcloud/thanks) as a thank you from the entire Nextcloud community. Note our 
[threat model](https://nextcloud.com/security/threat-model) to know what is expected behavior.
